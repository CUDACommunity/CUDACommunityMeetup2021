Hello CUDA community,

We're happy to announce our first online meetup! 
On January 4th we'll talk about CUDA memory consistency model and more.
We will add a link to the Zoom meeting closer to the event so stay tuned.

Speaker:
Georgy Evtushenko

Abstract:
The main source of non-deterministic concurrency bugs is a misunderstanding of the 
memory consistency model. If you don't understand the guarantees given by memory model,
you are risking to produce a bug, which might not show itself for a thousand of executions.
Moreover, if you use memory model guarantees correctly you can get significant performance improvements. 
During this talk I'll show an example of over than 40% runtime reduction achieved by deeper memory model understanding.
I've tried to make the talk rather pragmatic, so you can get a common sense of performance benefits along with safety issues.
For this talk you'll need to have basic knowledge of GPGPU programming.
